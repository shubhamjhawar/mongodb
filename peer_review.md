## Arin's Approach

- 1)Used pymongo to make a connection to the mongodb database.
        Used subprocess library to create a new collection inside of mongodb using python.
- 2)Used insert one function to insert into a collection.
- 3)Created separate classes for analyzing the comments, movies and theaters dataset.Modularity was maintained and written in OOPS format
  only required field were projected using the python functions
Using objects and classes can make your code more organized, modular, and easier
For the code was written in menu driven interactive mode as possible
Created separate functions for each query and mentioned the query inside of a pipeline
Generalised queries were used 
code is really well-structured and modular. It's easy to follow and understand
managed to create such a flexible and adaptable system using modular design principles.
The stages of the aggregation pipeline can be used to filter, transform, group, and sort data were used in the most of the questions



## Anuj Approach
- The code connects to a MongoDB database using the pymongo library and defines several functions to query the movies collection in the database.
- Each function implements a specific query to find top movies, directors, and actors based on different criteria
- The code uses the MongoDB aggregation pipelines to group and sort the data according to the specified criteria and limit the results to the top N entries.
- The function names are self-explanatory and reflect the purpose of the query. 
- The code uses comments to provide additional information and make it easier to follow the logic of each function. 
- The code is concise and avoids unnecessary complexity, making it efficient and easy to maintain.
 - Overall, the code is of high quality and meets its intended purpose of retrieving theater data based on specific criteria.
